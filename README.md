## Steps involved

1. Fork this repository.

2. Read [EvalAI challenge creation documentation](http://evalai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/challenge_creation.html#challenge-creation-using-zip-configuration) to know more about how you want to structure your challenge. Once you are ready, start making changes in the yaml file, HTML templates, evaluation script according to your need. 

3. Once you are done making changes, run the command `./run.sh` to generate the `challenge_config.zip`

4. Upload the `challenge_config.zip` on [EvalAI](https://evalai.cloudcv.org) to create a challenge on EvalAI. Challenge will be available publicly once EvalAI Admin approves the challenge.
