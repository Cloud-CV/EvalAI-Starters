```

## Create challenge using config

1. Fork this repository.

2. Read [EvalAI challenge creation documentation](https://evalai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) to know more about how you want to structure your challenge. Once you are ready, start making changes in the yaml file, HTML templates, evaluation script according to your need.

3. Once you are done making changes, run the command `./run.sh` to generate the `challenge_config.zip`.

4. Upload the `challenge_config.zip` on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai) to create a challenge on EvalAI. Challenge will be available publicly once EvalAI Admin approves the challenge.
   
5. To update the challenge on EvalAI, use the UI to update the details.

## Create challenge using github

1. Use this repository as [template](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

2. Generate your [github personal acccess token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and copy it in clipboard.

3. Add the github personal access token in the forked repository's [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the name `AUTH_TOKEN`.

4. Now, go to [EvalAI](https://eval.ai) to fetch the following details -
   1. `evalai_user_auth_token` - Go to [profile page](https://eval.ai/web/profile) after logging in and click on `Get your Auth Token` to copy your auth token.
   2. `host_team_pk` - Go to [host team page](https://eval.ai/web/challenge-host-teams) and copy the `ID` for the team you want to use for challenge creation.

5. Create a branch with name `challenge` in the forked repository from the `master` branch.
<span style="color:purple">Note: Only changes in `challenge` branch will be synchronized with challenge on EvalAI.</span>

6. Add `evalai_user_auth_token` and `host_team_pk` in `github/host_config.json`.

7. Read [EvalAI challenge creation documentation](https://evalai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) to know more about how you want to structure your challenge. Once you are ready, start making changes in the yaml file, HTML templates, evaluation script according to your need.

8. Commit the changes and push the `challenge` branch in the repository and wait for the build to complete. View the [logs of your build](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs/using-workflow-run-logs#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures).

9. If challenge config contains errors then a `issue` will be opened automatically in the repository with the errors otherwise the challenge will be created on EvalAI.

10. Go to [Hosted Challenges](https://eval.ai/web/hosted-challenges) to view your challenge. The challenge will be publicly available once EvalAI admin approves the challenge.

11. To update the challenge on EvalAI, make changes in the repository and push on `challenge` branch and wait for the build to complete.

## Test your evaluation script locally

In order to test the evaluation script locally before uploading it to [EvalAI](https://eval.ai) server, please follow the below instructions -

1. Copy the evaluation script i.e `__init__.py` , `main.py` and other relevant files from `evaluation_script/` directory to `challenge_data/challenge_1/` directory.

2. Now, edit `challenge_phase` name, `annotation file` name and `submission file` name in the `worker/run.py` file to the challenge phase codename (which you want to test for), annotation file name in the `annotations/` folder (for specific phase) and corresponding submission file respectively.

3. Run the command `python -m worker.run` from the directory where `annotations/` `challenge_data/` and `worker/` directories are present. If the command runs successfully, then the evaluation script works locally and will work on the server as well.
