<p>The goal of Object Detection Track is to benchmark the state-of-art performance of visual representations learned using self-supervised techniques on the task of Object Detection on Pascal VOC2007 dataset. </p>
<p>The model trained via self-supervision technique is used to generate object detection predictions on PASCAL VOC2007 dataset following Fast R-CNN approach. The entire model body is frozen and only the RoI heads are trained. We train on the trainval and test predictions on the test split.</p>
